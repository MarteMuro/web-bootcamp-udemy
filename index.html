        Although I’ve been writing stories for as long as I’ve been able to write
         (and I was dictating them even before that) I firmly believe that it’s never too
          late to start writing. But where to start writing a book if you have no experience
           in writing fiction and pretty much the only thing you’ve written is “book how to write” 
           in the Google search bar? These writing tips and writing exercises will help you get
            started and you’ll end up learning how to write a book that you’ll 
            be proud to share with the world.

        Before reading this post, please bear in mind that these are just my opinions and there
         are probably very experienced professional authors out there who say different things. 
         It’s just the way it is because writing is an art and there’s no wrong way to do art.
          “You become a better writer by writing” is probably the only thing that most writers 
          can agree on, so don’t dismiss the entire post even if you’ve read that Stephen King 
          or your best-selling author neighbour says something different than what I’m saying here.
